# MiLab-TurstShare

# Team:
Development - Maya Kerem
Product - Noa Shvartz and Ofir Ben Tzur

# Goal
As students in the MiLab, IDC, we dove into the field of transportation in Israel and the issues that surround it. 
After weeks of research and interviews we have decided to target the issue of carpooling in Israel. In Israel, in particular, people refrain from using carpooling services due to the lack of trust in carpool drivers, and thus increase the usage of carpooling and trust within communities.

# Development
The client side is developed for android devices in Java.
The server side is developed in Node.js while the database is SQL based and set up to work with Azure services (currently disconected due to subscription issues and prices)
